    <h1> Welcome to my calculator project </h1>
    <p>
      This website can make simple math calculations in the &quot;Calculator&quot;
      section.
      <br />
      In the &quot;Quote&quot; section, you can find a random mathematic-related quote!
      <br />
      Everything was done by using
      <span> React </span>
      (hooks, functional components & router).
